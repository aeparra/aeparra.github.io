I was looking into it a bit, and a GitHub account is used to store and share my coding projects to work with other developers.

My repository for now only has little information like my email or my name, but it can work as a tool to experiment.

Basically, I went to my preferred browser (Opera GX), created an account on the GitHub page, and then created a new repository. After that, I downloaded the app for my computer. After the installation, I logged in and selected the 'clone repository' option. Then I chose the location where I wanted to save it and clicked 'finish'.

# About Me
## Interest 
Hi everyone, my name is Amilcar Parra, I am 21 years old, and I am from Venezuela. I don't have many hobbies, but in my free time, I like to play soccer and baseball. I am studying programming because I have always been interested in computers and video games, and in the future, I would like to create one.
## Websites I Recommend
  - [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com) It is one of the websites I use the most in my day-to-day life. It is used to buy and download all kinds of video games or even other types of applications, such as screen recording software or desktop customization tools.
  - [Discord](https://discord.com) It is a website that allows you to communicate with people from anywhere in the world. It has a very active community, which allows you to meet people who can help you do all kinds of things or even find information that you wouldn't easily get on other websites.
