I was looking into it a bit, and a GitHub account is used to store and share my coding projects to work with other developers.

My repository for now only has little information like my email or my name, but it can work as a tool to experiment.

Basically, I went to my preferred browser (Opera GX), created an account on the GitHub page, and then created a new repository. After that, I downloaded the app for my computer. After the installation, I logged in and selected the 'clone repository' option. Then I chose the location where I wanted to save it and clicked 'finish'.
